Alan Kay defines the Dynabook, the basis for all
pen/tablet computers.
Inventor Doug Engelbart introduces the mouse,
e-mail, hypertext, collaborative editing,
bitmapped graphics

    <h1> <b>You Know Who Really Invented the Laptop?</b> </h1>
    <p>
        The history of personal computers, like most of human history, is a chronicle of our reach exceeding our grasp. Nowhere is this truer than with laptops and tablet PCs.

The supposedly portable computers of the early 1980s, such as Osborne 1 and Compaq, were conventional desktop computers with a small monitor screen and a handle.<br> <br>At an arm-extending 25 to 30 pounds and dependent on an AC outlet, they contributed nothing to laptop technology. In fact, the design for the first tablet PC was set out in 1968, long before most of the technologies necessary to build it were even invented.
<br>
<br>That design was the Dynabook, and its author was computer scientist Alan Kay. Its intended audience was children. With its windowed software environment, graphical programming language, and no-moving-parts keyboard, it was designed to be a rugged, inexpensive machine that would unleash creativity. After Kay joined Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), they built the Alto, which modeled the Dynabook’s software, but it was a console machine that weighed several hundred pounds. Note that a young technology enthusiast, Steve Jobs, and a team of engineers took a tour of Xerox PARC in 1979, where they saw demonstrations of the mouse and graphical user interface. Key aspects of what Jobs saw ultimately found their way into Apple’s machines. In 1994, Alan Kay became an Apple Fellow

        English students at LGF were instructed to think up a sentence with a prepositional phrase—“Jimmy jumped on a table”—and then create a short video of the sentence, which their classmates viewed on their laptops. “You never saw so much laughter and giggles,” says principal Deb Socia. “And I guarantee none of those students will ever forget what a preposition is.”
LGF has become the showcase for the growing belief that laptop computers, properly integrated into classrooms, can have a profound effect on how students learn and actor <br> <br> <b>The inner-city middle school is located in a gang-ridden area in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston. Thirty percent of the 670 students have special needs, and nine in 10 are considered low income.</b></p>
<br>In 2007, a program was initiated to give each student a laptop and integrate the technology into instruction in a meaningful way. At any given time, about one-third of the classrooms are engaged in some technology-related activities. Students blog immediately when they come into class to settle in. They’ve written and recorded their own protest songs on their laptops while studying the First Amendment.
    </p>
    <h1><b>Shape of Things to Come</b></h1>
Imagine that your laptop could be reconfigured into different shapes and sizes, like a Transformer toy, depending on your computing task at any given moment. Or that it could be solar-powered, giving you an almost limitless power supply. Or that it could serve as “the brain” of your house, managing everything from appliances to your personal diabetes monitor.<br>
<br>
<mark>Some of these notions exist in prototype; others are tantalizing theories. Experts were asked to predict what the laptop will look like, and what technological breakthroughs will appear, over the next decade. While their views varied, one clear consensus formed: In an increasingly mobile society, where laptops have already passed desktop computers in popularity, these devices will exert an ever-greater influence on how we work, communicate and live.</mark>
